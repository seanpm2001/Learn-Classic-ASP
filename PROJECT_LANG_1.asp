<!-- Project language file 1
For: seanpm2001/Learn-Classic-ASP
About:
I decided to make Classic ASP (Classic Action Server Pages, or Classic ASP) the main project language file for this project (Seanpm2001/Learn-Classic-ASP) as Classic ASP is the language this project is dedicated to, because this project is about learning the Classic ASP programming language. It only makes sense to Classic ASP the official language for this project. It is getting its own project language file, starting here.
